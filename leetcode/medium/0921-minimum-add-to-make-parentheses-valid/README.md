# Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string,
- It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
- It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

You are given a parentheses string `s`. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

- For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".

Return  *the minimum number of moves required to make* `s` *valid*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s[i] is either '(' or ')'.

class Solution {
public:
    int minAddToMakeValid(string s) {
        int open = 0;
        int closed = 0;
        for(char ch : s){
            if(ch=='(') open++;
            else {
                if(open > 0) open--;
                else closed++;
            }
        }
        return open + closed;
    }
};
```
